# pygame
playing with pygame

The sprites folder contains some image files.
To run a file, install the python packages in the requirements.txt and run the python script. 

Games 0 through 3 involve a progression of various stages of collision implementation. 
In particular, game3.py, game4.py, and collisionsim.py employ different strategies to detect the normal direction of a collision, and transfer momentum across this direction.

The program collisionsim.py allows for the specificaiton of both masses and also the file path of whatever images are to be used in the sim. 
The code in collisionsim.py is also cleaned up from game4.py, and I hope it is a bit more readable now :).
